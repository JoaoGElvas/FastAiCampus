# FastAiCampus

This project is based on the lessons from the first part of the [FastAI Course - Lesson 1](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html). It explores foundational concepts in deep learning using Jupyter Notebook and datasets sourced from Kaggle.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Techniques**: Implements techniques covered in the first lesson of the FastAI course.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: All code and experiments are documented in Jupyter Notebook.
- **Kaggle Datasets**: Uses Kaggle as the primary source for datasets to power the models and experiments.
